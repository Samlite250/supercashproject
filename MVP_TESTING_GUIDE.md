## Known Limitations (MVP)

⚠️ **Email Verification**: Bypassed for MVP (users auto-verified on registration)
- ✅ Can be re-enabled in production by modifying `/backend/src/controllers/authController.js`

⚠️ **Profile Pictures**: Currently using gradient placeholders
- ✅ Upload functionality structure exists, needs file handling implementation

⚠️ **Daily Earnings**: Cron job exists but may need manual triggering
- ✅ Check `/backend/src/utils/cron.js` for earnings calculation

⚠️ **Mobile Optimization**: Partially implemented
- ✅ Responsive grid layouts work, may need tweaking for very small screens

⚠️ **Payment Gateway Integration**: Not implemented
- ✅ Only deposit/withdrawal request UI present, actual payment processing deferred

## Troubleshooting

### 🔴 "Backend not running" Error
**Solution:**
```bash
cd c:\xamppx\htdocs\Super\backend
npm start
```

### 🔴 "Frontend not loading"
**Solution:**
```bash
cd c:\xamppx\htdocs\Super\frontend
npm start
```

### 🔴 "Database connection error"
**Verify MySQL:**
```bash
mysql -u root supercash
SHOW TABLES;
```

### 🔴 "Invalid credentials" on admin login
**Create admin user:**
```bash
cd c:\xamppx\htdocs\Super\backend
node create-admin.js
```

### 🔴 "No investment plans showing"
**Seed machines:**
```bash
cd c:\xamppx\htdocs\Super\backend
node insert-machines.js
```
